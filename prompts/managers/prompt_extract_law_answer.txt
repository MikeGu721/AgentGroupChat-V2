Given a legal problem and its discussion, identify the correct answer in the discussion and output it after "#### ".
You should extract the correct final choices, and just output the answer without any units.

Example:
Problem: According to the Civil Code of the People's Republic of China, which of the following rights are classified as property rights? A. Ownership, B. Easement, C. Mortgage, D. Creditor's Right
Discussion: Ownership (A) is a fundamental type of property right, which grants the right holder direct control and exclusive rights over a specific asset. Easement (B) is a type of usufructuary property right, allowing the right holder to use another's immovable property for the convenience or enhancement of their own property. Mortgage (C) is a type of security property right, enabling the creditor to have priority in compensation from a specific asset if the debtor fails to fulfill their obligations. Creditor's Right (D), on the other hand, is not a property right but rather a separate category of rights under civil law, which allows the right holder to request a specific action from the obligor. Therefore, the correct answers are A, B, and C.
Output: #### ABC
